A pseudo fully differential Low-Noise Amplifier (LNA) was designed in 130 nm SiGe BiCMOS technology using BJT devices for high-frequency RF front-end applications. 
Resonant feedback techniques were employed to enhance bandwidth while maintaining low noise performance. 
The proposed LNA achieves a wide bandwidth of 33.1 GHz with a noise figure of 2.5 dB, demonstrating effective noise suppression through the differential architecture. 
A gain of 19.1 dB is achieved, along with strong linearity characterized by a 1-dB compression point ($P_{1\text{dB}}$) of 19.32 dBm and an output third-order intercept point (OIP3) of 24.6 dBm. 
These results validate the design’s suitability for very high-frequency RF receiver front-end applications.
